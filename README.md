# stock viewer app

objective to build a frontend app to display income statements and balance sheets for a specific ticker

requirements

node 18+
npm

steps to start
put your api key into a .env file following the pattern in .env.example
in the console run `npm install` and then `npm run start` to launch the app

problems
due to a lack of experience with MUI some time was wasted with the autocomplete field in the ticker picker.
due to being rate limited on the api, I could not fully test out the ticker selections.
I ran out of time doing the build due to hyperfixating on the business logic and did not make the best possible user interface.
